#145_CppClassForDiagonalMatrix

### 1. Diagonal Matrix:
A diagonal matrix is a special type of square matrix where all elements outside the main diagonal are zero. The main diagonal runs from the top left to the bottom right of the matrix. Mathematically, a diagonal matrix \( D \) of size \( n \times n \) can be represented as:

\[
D = \begin{bmatrix}
d_{1} & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & d_{2} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & d_{3} & \dots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & d_{n}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### 2. Implementing Diagonal Matrix in a Single Array and Importance of Destructor:

#### Implementation Approach:
To represent a diagonal matrix efficiently, it's possible to use a one-dimensional array to store only the diagonal elements, as all other elements are zero. The position of each element in the array corresponds to its position in the diagonal matrix.

#### Importance of Destructor in a Class:
When a class is used to implement a diagonal matrix, the destructor becomes essential for proper memory management. If the class allocates dynamic memory for the diagonal elements or utilizes resources that need to be released, the destructor ensures the proper cleanup of these resources when the object is destroyed or goes out of scope. This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures the efficient use of resources.

### 3. Set and Get Functions Checking for \( i == j \):
In a class representing a diagonal matrix, the set and get functions can include checks to ensure that elements are only set or retrieved when the row index (\( i \)) is equal to the column index (\( j \)), as only these positions contain non-zero elements in a diagonal matrix.

These set and get functions ensure that operations are performed only on diagonal elements of the matrix, enhancing the integrity of the diagonal matrix representation.
